# Nand2Tetris Projects

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Nand2Tetris course, a comprehensive journey through building a modern computer system from the ground upâ€”from logic gates to high-level programming. The course is structured around a series of hands-on projects that incrementally introduce the components of a simple yet powerful computer system.

## Course Structure
- **Project 1: Boolean Logic**
  - Design of basic logic gates using Nand gates.
- **Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic**
  - Implementation of arithmetic operations using the logic gates designed in Project 1.
- **Project 3: Sequential Logic**
  - Introduction to flip-flops and basic memory units.
- **Project 4: Machine Language**
  - Development of programs using the Hack machine language.
- **Project 5: Computer Architecture**
  - Integration of the ALU, registers, and RAM into a complete computer system.
- **Project 6: Assembler**
  - Building an assembler to translate assembly language into machine code.
- **Project 7 & 8: VM I & II**
  - Translation of VM code into assembly, handling function calls.
- **Project 10: Compiler I**
  - Syntax analysis and code generation from high-level language to VM code.
- **Project 11: Compiler II**
  - Completion of the compiler, handling all features of the Jack language.

## Technologies Used
- HDL (Hardware Description Language)
- Hack Assembly Language
- VM Language
- Jack high-level programming language
